# Privacy Preserving Disease Detection using Neural Networks

### Abstract
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple and cost efficient method used to diagnose heart disorders by detecting the electrical impulses from the heart. Bundle Branch
Block (BBB) is a heart disorder caused by the blockage in the human heart. This disorder causes fluctuations in the ECG waves, from which it can be detected.
Nowadays, since most of the operations happen in the cloud due to requirement for greater computation power, there is always a concern for privacy of data. So,we
propose a privacy preserving disease detection model based on Neural Networks for the automatic detection of Left and Right Bundle Blocks. It includes computation of 5-statistical features obtained from the extracted QRS complex of the ECG wave. It uses CKKS Homomorphic encryption scheme to encrypt the computed
features and sent to the cloud for detection using Neural Network. The proposed technique uses CPSC 2018 Dataset and obtained an accuracy of
84.3
